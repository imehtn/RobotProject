**PROBLEM**

The team was tasked with designing a robot that could complete gardening and maintenance tasks for Brutus Buckeyeâ€™s Garden. These tasks include carrying an apple bucket up a ramp and depositing it either on a table or in a crate, rotating a compost bin, opening a window, pushing the appropriate humidifier button, and flipping the appropriate lever. These were to be completed within two minutes of starting.
The final design of the robot accomplishes all these tasks using two mechanisms. The first mechanism is a lever arm that can lift and drop the apple bucket, as well as flip the appropriate lever. The second mechanism is a rotating claw that can turn the compost bin. These mechanisms in tandem with the chassis of the robot can also be used to open and close the window and press the appropriate humidifier button. 


**CODE** 

Final code used with the Proteus controller to control the robot is store in the "Final Folder"
Code used for Milestones and Explorations can be found in the appropriate folders as well.
